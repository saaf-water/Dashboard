# saaf-water Dashboard

saaf-water is a network of active devices installed at various water sources, it shows the latest metrics of water quality like TDS, turbidity, pH, Electrical conductivity, temperature, pathogen presence and a simple to understand Water quality summary and map which shows the water status, recommend use, and suggestions before usage. We believe that an open-source, free to use, community monitored data on climate can help tackle it.

saaf-water Dashboard can be used by local authorities to monitor various aspects of data about water quality and they can also check predicted data powered by Machine Learning.

We're also using this 'saaf-water Dashboard' to notify water-quality and how to improve / take precautions the end user via website, SMS, Whatsapp.
